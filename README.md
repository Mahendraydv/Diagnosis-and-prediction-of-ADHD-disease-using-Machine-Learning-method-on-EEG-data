# Diagnosis and Prediction of ADHD Disease using Machine Learning Methods on EEG Data

This repository contains the code and resources for the major project named "Diagnosis and Prediction of ADHD Disease using Machine Learning Methods on EEG Data." In this project, we have utilized EEG data obtained from IEEE and applied five machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Neighbours Classifier, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The accuracies achieved by these algorithms are as follows:

- Logistic Regression: 60.25%
- K-Neighbours Classifier: 92.01%
- Gaussian Naïve Bayes: 63.39%
- Decision Tree Classifier: 84.43%
- Random Forest Classifier: 89.70%

Among all the algorithms, the K-Neighbours Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy of 92.01%.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ashwinimishra24/Diagnosis-and-prediction-of-ADHD-disease-using-Machine-Learning-method-on-EEG-data
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained from IEEE. It consists of EEG recordings from individuals diagnosed with ADHD. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size, but it can be accessed and downloaded from the IEEE website (provide the URL or instructions for accessing the dataset).


## Usage

To replicate or build upon this project, follow the steps below:

1. Download the dataset from IEEE (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/eeg-data-adhd-control-children).
2. Place the dataset in Jupitor notebook or Colab notebook.
3. Install the necessary dependencies. 
4. Explore the notebooks in the `MajorProject.ipynb` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.
5. Run the notebooks sequentially to preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
8. Analyze the results, experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters, and refine the models accordingly.
